    "He's a superb example of a public coin &ndash; totally transparent with his open-source body, and decentralised with all his limbs spread out. Did you know, the glass octopus has its brain spread out across its whole body? Fascinating!",
    "But let's not forget the other public coins who are just as great as old bitcoin here. In time, maybe they will be the Zoo's main attraction. Exciting!"];
